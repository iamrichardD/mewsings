2. Technical Considerations (Application Level):

* Backend Technology: NestJS (Node.js framework)
    * Rationale:  Modern, scalable, efficient for real-time applications, good for API development, TypeScript support, suitable for microservices architecture if needed in the future.

* Frontend Technology: Vue.js
    * Rationale:  Progressive framework, component-based architecture, performant, relatively easy to learn, good for interactive UIs, good ecosystem and community support.

* Database: PostgreSQL
    * Rationale:  Robust, reliable, scalable, relational database, good for structured data, supports JSON and full-text search capabilities, open-source, widely used.

* Real-time Communication (for Group Chat): WebSockets
    * Rationale:  Industry standard for real-time bidirectional communication in web applications, well-suited for chat functionality.  Likely already chosen/required by the separate "Group Chat Module Prompt Document".

* Deployment: Docker and Containerization
    * Rationale:  Enables consistent and portable deployment across different environments, simplifies deployment and scaling, good for microservices architecture, facilitates CI/CD pipelines.

* API Communication: RESTful APIs (primarily) and WebSockets (for Group Chat)
    * Rationale: REST is a widely adopted standard for API development, suitable for most data exchange needs. WebSockets are specifically for real-time bidirectional communication required by the Group Chat module.  Using a combination allows for flexibility and efficiency.

* Development Environment:  To be defined in detail in Phase 0 Deliverables (but generally: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Vue CLI, preferred IDE/code editor).


3. Scale and Performance Requirements (Application Level):

* User Load Expectations (MVP Phase): Low usage, initial testing with a limited number of users (e.g., internal team, small beta group).  Target concurrent users during peak MVP testing: [Specify - Suggest: 100-200 concurrent users].  Assume gradual user onboarding during MVP.  High scalability is not a primary concern for MVP, focus is on functional validation with a limited user base.

* Performance Requirements (MVP Phase):
    * General Responsiveness:  Platform should be reasonably responsive for typical user interactions (page loads, content creation/submission, chat messaging).  Specific numerical latency targets are *not* strictly defined for the MVP, focus is on *qualitative* user-perceived responsiveness being "acceptable" or better for core workflows.
    * Content Loading: Narrative writings should load and render in a reasonable time (e.g., within [Specify - Suggest: 2-3 seconds] for typical text-based content over a reasonable network connection - qualitative target for MVP).
    * Chat Message Delivery: Group Chat messages should be delivered in near real-time (sub-second latency for message delivery within a group chat - qualitative target for MVP).
    * System Uptime: Aim for at least 99% system uptime during expected usage hours for the platform in the MVP phase.

* Scalability Considerations (Beyond MVP):  While high scalability is not an MVP goal, the chosen technology stack (NestJS, Vue.js, PostgreSQL, Docker) should be inherently scalable to accommodate future growth and increased user load in subsequent iterations after MVP.  Microservices architecture approach in backend (NestJS) should be considered for future scalability if needed.
